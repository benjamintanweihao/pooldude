Pooldude â€“ A chunky Elixir worker pool factory
========

Pooldude is meant to be an Elixir clone of the excellent [Poolboy](https://github.com/devinus/poolboy) by Devin Torres.

I hope this can make it to become an example in the [book](http://www.exotpbook.com), where we build Poolboy from scratch in Elixir.

Other interesting aspects are the QuickCheck tests written in Poolboy.
